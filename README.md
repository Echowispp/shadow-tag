## Shadow Tag
This is a game where you try to escape a maze while your shadow tried to chase and kill you. You can deter the shadow with your flashlight, but not forever as the batteries will eventually run out. 

Controls: WASD movement, [Space] or LMB to put on flashlight. 

A quick history of how I made this: 
1. Basic movement
2. I added the shadow and its movement
3. After that, I continued with the logical chain of features to add by making the shadow stop in light,
4. shortly after I added the flashlight cooldown.
5. Here was where I added the shadow's unstuck mechanic, teleporting behind the player (although it took me over two days to realize it wasn't teleporting to the other side of the player, as I'd intended)
6. Then, before building the level, I made the lantern lights and made them interact with the shadow just like the player flashlight
7. Next, I built the level
8. At this point, I realized you couln't win or lose in this game, so added the shadow killing the player on touch and the four corners letting the player 'escape the maze' and giving a win screen. There is also a restart button on the death screen, in case you don't beat the game in one attempt (I must admit that the game is pretty hard though)

Uhh yeah that's it, I did also do minor bug fixes during most stages of development whenever I noticed some.
Also I hope this is how you do a tech stack, I'm not too experienced in these kinds of things
